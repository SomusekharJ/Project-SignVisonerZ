Gesture Translation for Sign Language Recognition
Overview


-This project is designed to translate gestures from sign language into readable text using machine learning models. It helps bridge the communication gap between sign language users and non-sign language speakers by converting gestures into text in real-time.

-The project uses image and video processing techniques to identify sign language gestures and map them to corresponding letters or words. It can be applied in various fields such as education, communication tools for the hearing-impaired, and more.
Features


-Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Translates gestures into text in real-time using camera input.

-Video Input Support: Can process video inputs to detect and translate continuous sign language gestures.

-Word Suggestions: Provides real-time word suggestions based on the letters and words being recognized.

-Customizable Dictionary: Allows users to modify the dictionary to improve word prediction accuracy.

-Easy to Train: The model can be retrained with new gesture data for better performance or additional signs.


Technologies Used


-Python: Core programming language for developing the project.

-OpenCV: For video/image capture and processing.

-TensorFlow / Keras: For building and training the gesture recognition model.

-RandomForestClassifier: For classifying the gestures.NumPy and Pandas: For data manipulation.Matplotlib: For visualizing the dataset and model training process.

-Flask/Django (Optional): If deploying as a web application.
